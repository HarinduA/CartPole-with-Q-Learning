# CartPole-with-Q-Learning

An AI bot that learns to play the classic **CartPole-v1** game using **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)**. Built with Python and OpenAI Gym, the agent learns to balance a pole by maximizing rewards through trial and error.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Trains an agent to play CartPole using Q-learning (discretized state space)
- Visualizes learning progress with reward plots
- Optionally renders live gameplay after training

# ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

numpy: For numerical computations

- gym: For the CartPole environment
- matplotlib: For plotting training rewards
- pandas: (Optional) For storing training logs and analysis
- seaborn: (Optional) For enhanced visualizations
- random: For exploration during training
- time: For rendering and timing operations
